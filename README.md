# 🛠️ Data Cleaning using MySQL

## 🔹 About the Project  
This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a dataset of layoffs using MySQL.  
The dataset contained duplicate records, NULL values, and inconsistent formatting, which were addressed using SQL techniques.  

## 🛠️ Steps Performed:
1️⃣ **Removing Duplicates** using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER()`.  
2️⃣ **Standardizing Data** (trimming spaces, converting text to lowercase).  
3️⃣ **Handling NULL Values** (filling missing data where possible).  
4️⃣ **Changing Data Types** for consistency (e.g., converting `TEXT` to `DATE`).
